"""
When python interpreter starts, int objects are pre allocated for itegers ranging from -5 to 256. Python does this to increase program efficiency by reusing int objects rather than creating new ones everytime an integer is used in the code
Because pre allocated integers range is between -5 to 256, a total of of 262 integers are pre allocated i.e. (257 - (-5)). As a result the number of int objects  reated before executing line 2 is 262
